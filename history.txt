RELEASE HISTORY

- 1.1 on 2004-06-07
	- Changed the interpreter state to use mutable unboxed arrays (Data.Array.IO) 
	  instead of the pure functional Haskell 98 arrays (Array module). Data.Array.IO
	  is part of the GHC hierarchical libraries and is implemented in Hugs too 
	  (but not in nhc). Performance increased dramatically as a result. 

	  
- 1.0 on 2004-06-04
	- Initial release
